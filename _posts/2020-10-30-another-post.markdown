## A subtitle

Among a lot of things I’m trying to do these days, there is a constant desire to write. Not really because there is a “Retour en grâce” of blogging, but because I always loved writing.

Unfortunately, at the exception of a music blog I had some years ago, I didn’t succeed at this game.
[Test](There are many reasons for that).

### A sub sub title

> The fear of showing what I write publicly. The imposter syndrome. The lack of time to properly dedicate myself to the discipline (because I think that writing is a discipline).

The many temptations that put me out of the way (what platform should I use ?

- Should I write in English ?
- Or French ? Am I using the right tone ?
- Am I saying the right thing ?
- And who the fuck will care about what I write ?)

I don’t have a plan or a strategy. I only want to write and be better at it.

To grow that skill and to enjoy the process.
After all, I don’t have any pressure: I don’t have an audience yet. I should just let the words flow, as I did here, and see where it will lead.
